Readme file for the PC-Builder Sinatra Project

This Sinatra website allows users to create their own custom builds of PCs.
Any user can look at PC builds of other users. But they need to login to create a new build. A build name is associated with a system configuration. System can be edited, deleted & the association can be changed to a different build.

I have used Sinatra for the backend & Materialize for the frontend.
